## Project Overview
This project seeks to buildout and deploy of full analytics platform for the fantasy football league I am a part.
This fantasy league is hosted on ESPN Fantasy, however I found the available data and analysis somewhat lacking/rigid. 
So this project is broken out into 4 components; the data warehouse, the analysis library,
the self-service dashboard, and the ML models.

### Data Warehouse
The first component that is the data warehouse that will serve every other component of this project.
